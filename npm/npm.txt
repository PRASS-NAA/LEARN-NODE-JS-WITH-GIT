node package manager is a large open source library 

using npm u can download many dependencies ...using it u can finish ur project easily without doing everything from scratch


1. first create a index.js file 

for ur project first initialize node

npm init
this will create package.json (this file contains neccesary info abt ut projects.... whenever u dowload a module for that project, dependcies key will be updated)

to install a package -> npm install (i) something.


2. To Use a package we can either use import statement or require statement
   2.1 require
       1. by default we can use require so dont change anything in package.json
          const name = require('packagename')
   2.2 import
       1. If u want to use import statements go to package.json and tyep "type":"module"
